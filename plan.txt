1. Measure the dimensions of all furniture.
2. Measure the room dimensions, including windows, doors, radiators, and electrical outlets to understand spatial limitations.

4. Remove smaller objects, then clean the floor to prepare for moving.
5. Empty heavy furniture like bookshelves or drawers to reduce weight and make them easier to reposition.
6. Move the furniture based on the chosen layout and available space to maneuver, starting with the largest and heaviest items such as the bed and wardrobe.
